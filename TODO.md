# TODO

This file is only relevant while turboGliph is being refactored for 
Bioconductor to keep track of applied changes.

<br>

Initial goals:

- Make sure the package fulfills all relevant [Bioconductor Package Guidelines](https://bioconductor.org/developers/package-guidelines/)

- Refactor the code into smaller functions/units

- Double-check the correctness of the GLIPH implementation

- Identify and eliminate possible problems (for example too big networks 
crashing R Studio)

- Optimize performance, if possible (for example by translating functions 
to C++)
